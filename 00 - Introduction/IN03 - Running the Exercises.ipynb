    "Another reason for problems could be when you forgot to run the **initialization cell** at the top of each notebook. This cell loads and initializes the request functions and other configurations, and must be run for each notebook or when restarting a notebook's kernel. When you see some strange error messages that look like program code, then please run the initialization cell."
