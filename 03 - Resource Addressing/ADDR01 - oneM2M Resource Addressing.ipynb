    "# oneM2M Resource Addressing\n",
    "\n",
    "oneM2M defines an addressing scheme for resources that can be a bit confusing at first. This seemingly complex scheme takes into account that resources can be addressed locally on the same CSE or remotely on a different hosting CSE. It also defines different representations to directly address a resource by its *resource identifier* attribute, or in a structured way that provides a path through the parent's resource  hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following diagram provides an overview about the general format of an address. How an address looks like depends on its scope (whether the resource targeting is supposed to be CSE relative, service provider relative, or absolute) and how it is structured (unstructured, structured, or hybrid).\n",
    "\n",
    "![](../images/ADDR-overview.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Address Scopes\n",
    "\n",
    "First we will explain the three address scopes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### CSE Relative\n",
    "\n",
    "This scope is for requests and addresses that refer to resources hosted on the target CSE. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you only have one CSE instance in your deployment, or if no AE will ever be addressing a resource hosted on another CSE, then this scope might be the one used often. \n",
    "\n",
    "In these lectures and examples we mostly only use *CSE relative* scope for identifiers for readability.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "```aResourceID```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Service Provider Relative\n",
    "\n",
    "This scope is to address resources hosted on different CSEs within a service provider domain. These are all the resources and CSE instances within a single CSE deployment structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since resource identifiers (structured and unstructured) only need to be unique for a single CSE all identifiers will be prefixed with the *CSE identifier* that uniquely identifies the hosting CSE of the targeted resource. Please note, that a *CSE identifier* always starts with a slash (/), which means that a *Service Provider relative* address also starts with a single slash.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "```/aCseID/aResourceID```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Absolute\n",
    "\n",
    "In case your CSE deployment structure is one of many such deployments then it is not enough to use just *CSE identifers* as prefixes (because these only need to be unique within a service provider domain). \n",
    "\n",
    "If an AE needs to address a resource on a CSE of a different service provider then, in addtion to the *CSE identifier*, also the *Service Provider identifier* is added as an additional prefix. To distinguish an *Absolute* from a *Service Provider relative* address two extra slashes (//) are added to the front of the address.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "```//aServiceProviderID/aCseID/aResourceID```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Address Structuring\n",
    "\n",
    "We will now have a look at the differences between *unstructured* and *structured* resources identifiers.  We will also explain what *hybrid* resource identifiers are and when to use them.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Unstructured Resource Identifiers\n",
    "\n",
    "Unstructured resource identifiers are the simplest ones: they are basically the same as a resource's *resourceIdentifier* attribute. Those values are unique for a CSE, so it is simple to address a resource this way when you know this value.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Structured Resource Identifiers\n",
    "\n",
    "Structured resource identifiers are similar to file paths in a computer's file system. They follow a similar structure of path elements (ie. the values of the resource's *resourceName* attributes along the path) and separators to uniquely identify a resource. \n",
    "\n",
    "Any resource can be identified by following a path through the resource tree, starting from the \\<CSEBase> resource itself. The *resourceName* of the \\<CSEBase> is always the first path element, and it can be followed by any number of path separators (oneM2M uses the slash character \"/\") and other resource names.\n",
    "\n",
    "This addressing type can be useful when you build a resource tree, and you know where to CREATE, UPDATE etc the resources in this structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hybrid Resource Identifiers\n",
    "\n",
    "Hybrid addressing is only valid when addressing virtual resources when using *unstructured resource identifiers*. Normally, virtual resources can easily addressed when using *structured resource identifier* by adding the virtual resource's name to the resource path. This is not possible when using *unstructured resource identifiers*. In this case, similar when using *structured resource identifers*, the virtual resource's name is appended to the *unstructured resource identifier*.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section we want give some examples. These are based on the resource tree in the following figure.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](../images/ADDR-resources.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The *Service Provider* domain is \"example.com\". In this domain there is a hosting CSE with the *CSE Identifier* of \"/id-in\", a *resourceName* of \"cse-in\", and a *resourceIdentifier* of \"id-in\". Other resources are an \\<AE> and a \\<container> child resource. The latter has the usual \\<latest> and \\<oldest> virtual child resource.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first line in the \"Unstructured\" and \"Structured\" rows address the \\<CSEBase> resource, the second line the \\<container> \"myContainer\". \n",
    "\n",
    "For the \"Hybrid\" row we can only show examples for addressing the \\<container> and its \\<latest> virtual child resource, because this addressing type is only valid for virtual resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
